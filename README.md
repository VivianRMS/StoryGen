# StoryGen

StoryGen is an interactive learning app designed to help children improve their reading skills by allowing them to generate and engage with stories of their choice. Harnessing the power of ChatGPT, StoryGen enables children to create stories tailored to their reading level and interests, allowing them to learn at an accelerated rate.


## Features

1. **Interactive Story Generation:**
   - Children input their reading level and keywords or topics of interest.
   - The app generates stories sentence by sentence at a slow pace, providing ample time for children to read and comprehend.

2. **Multifaceted Learning:**
   - **Listen Aloud Feature:** Users can listen to the generated stories out loud, enhancing their auditory learning.
   - **Sentence Structure Visualization:** Nouns and verbs are highlighted to aid in understanding sentence structure.

3. **Engaging Activities:**
   - **Generate New Story:** Children can create a new story with the same keywords, fostering creativity and exploration.
   - **Word Spelling Practice:** For new words encountered, children can practice spelling, reinforcing vocabulary.

### Acknowledgements
StoryGen was created by Prisha Agnihotri, Vivian Kunlin, Alisha Patel, and Aarushi Singh during the MHacks hackathon. Kunlin and Prisha worked heavily on backend, while Alisha and Aarushi worked heavily on frontend. This project would not have been possible without each and every team member, who contributed equally, though the commit history does not reflect this, as Vscode liveshare was used to work on the project simultaneously. We would also like to acknowledge the support of the MHacks organizers and mentors for making this project possible.
